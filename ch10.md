# Applicative Functors

## Applying Applicatives
## 应用 applicative

The name **applicative functor** is pleasantly descriptive given its functional origins. Functional programmers are notorious for coming up with names like `mappend` or `liftA4`, which seem perfectly natural when viewed in the math lab, but hold the clarity of an indecisive darth vader at the drive thru in any other context.

考虑到其函数式的出身，**applicative functor** 这个名称堪称简单明了。函数式程序员最为人诟病的一点就是，总喜欢搞一些稀奇古怪的命名，比如 `mappend` 或者 `liftA4`。诚然，此类名称出现在数学实验室是再自然不过的，但是放在其他任何语境下，这些概念就都像是汽车餐馆里扮作达斯维达的故意搞怪的服务员。（译者注：此处需要做些解释，1. 汽车餐馆（drive-thru）指的是那种不需要顾客下车就能提供服务的地方，一般是小餐馆；2. 达斯维达（Darth Vader）是《星球大战》系列主要反派角色，在美国大众文化中的有着广泛的影响力，其造型是很多人致敬模仿和恶搞的对象；3. 由于 2 的缘故，美国一些 drive-thru 会有扮作 Darth Vader 的服务员，在为顾客服务的时候做一些恶搞，YouTube 上有不少这种搞怪视频；4. 作者使用这个“典故”是为了说明函数式里很多概念的名称有些“故弄玄虚”，而 applicative functor 是少数比较“正常”的。）

Anyhow, the name should spill the beans on what this interface gives us: *the ability to apply functors to each other*.

无论如何，applicative 这个名字应该能够向我们表明一些事实，告诉我们作为一个接口，它能为我们带来什么：那就是让不同 functor 可以相互应用（apply）的能力。

Now, why would a normal, rational person, such as yourself, want such a thing? What does it even *mean* to apply one functor to another?

然而，你可能为会问了，为何一个正常的、理性的人，比如你自己，会做这种“让不同 functor 相互应用”的事？而且，“相互应用”到底*是什么意思*？

To answer these questions, we'll start with a situation you may have already encountered in your functional travels. Let's say, hypothetically, that we have two functors (of the same type) and we'd like to call a function with both of their values as arguments. Something simple like adding the values of two `Container`s.

要回答这些问题，我们可以从下面这个场景讲起，可能你已经碰到过这种场景了。假设有两个同类型的 functor，我们想把这两者作为一个函数的两个参数传递过去来调用这个函数。简单的例子比如让两个 `Container` 的值相加：

```js
// we can't do this because the numbers are bottled up.
// 这样是行不通的，因为 2 和 3 都藏在瓶子里。
add(Container.of(2), Container.of(3));
//NaN

// Let's use our trusty map
// 使用可靠的 map 函数试试
var container_of_add_2 = map(add, Container.of(2));
// Container(add(2))
```

We have ourselves a `Container` with a partially applied function inside. More specifically, we have a `Container(add(2))` and we'd like to apply its `add(2)` to the `3` in `Container(3)` to complete the call. In other words, we'd like to apply one functor to another.

这时候我们创建了一个 `Container`，它内部的值是一个局部调用的（partially applied）的函数。确切点讲就是，我们想让 `Container(add(2))` 中的 `add(2)` 应用到 `Container(3)` 中的 `3` 上来完成调用。也就是说，我们想把一个 functor 应用到另一个上。

Now, it just so happens that we already have the tools to accomplish this task. We can `chain` and then `map` the partially applied `add(2)` like so:

巧的是，完成这种任务的工具已经存在了，即 `chain` 函数。我们可以先 `chain` 然后再 `map` 那个局部调用的 `add(2)`，就像这样：

```js
Container.of(2).chain(function(two) {
  return Container.of(3).map(add(two));
});
```

The issue here is that we are stuck in the sequential world of monads wherein nothing may be evaluated until the previous monad has finished its business. We have ourselves two strong, independent values and I should think it unnecessary to delay the creation of `Container(3)` merely to satisfy the monad's sequential demands.

只不过，这种方式有一个问题，那就是 monad 的顺序执行问题：所有的代码都只会在前一个 monad 执行完毕之后才执行。想想看，我们的这两个值足够强健且相互独立，如果仅仅为了满足 monad 的顺序要求而延迟 `Container(3)` 的创建，我觉得是非常没有必要的。

In fact, it would be lovely if we could succinctly apply one functor's contents to another's value without these needless functions and variables should we find ourselves in this pickle jar.

事实上，当遇到这种问题的时候，要是能够无需借助这些不必要的函数和变量，以一种简明扼要的方式把一个 functor 的值应用到另一个上去就好了。


## Ships in bottles
## 瓶中之船

<img src="images/ship_in_a_bottle.jpg" alt="http://hollycarden.deviantart.com" />

`ap` is a function that can apply the function contents of one functor to the value contents of another. Say that 5 times fast.

`ap` 就是这样一种函数，能够把一个 functor 的函数值应用到另一个 functor 的值上。把这句话快速地说上 5 遍。

```js
Container.of(add(2)).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)

// all together now
Container.of(2).map(add).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)
```

There we are, nice and neat. Good news for `Container(3)` as it's been set free from the jail of the nested monadic function. It's worth mentioning again that `add`, in this case, gets partially applied during the first `map` so this only works when `add` is curried.

这样就大功告成了，而且代码干净整洁。对 `Container(3)` 来说，好消息是它从嵌套的 monad 函数的牢笼中释放了出来。需要再次强调的是，本例中的 `add` 是被 `map` 所局部调用（partially applied）的，所以 `add` 必须是一个 curry 函数。

We can define `ap` like so:

可以这样定义一个 `ap` 函数：

```js
Container.prototype.ap = function(other_container) {
  return other_container.map(this.__value);
}
```

Remember, `this.__value` will be a function and we'll be accepting another functor so we need only `map` it. And with that we have our interface definition:

记住，`this.__value` 是一个函数，将会接收另一个 functor 作为参数，所以我们只需 `map` 它。由此我们可以得出 applicative functor 的定义：


> An *applicative functor* is a pointed functor with an `ap` method

> applicative functor 是实现了 `ap` 方法的 pointed functor

Note the dependence on **pointed**. The pointed interface is crucial here as we'll see throughout the following examples.

注意 `pointed` 这个前提，这是非常重要的一个前提，下面的例子会说明这一点。

Now, I sense your skepticism (or perhaps confusion and horror), but keep an open mind; this `ap` character will prove useful. Before we get into it, let's explore a nice property.

讲到这里，我已经感受到你的疑虑了（也或者是困惑和恐惧）；心态开放点嘛，`ap` 还是很有用的。在深入理解这个概念之前，我们先来探索一个特性。

```js
F.of(x).map(f) == F.of(f).ap(F.of(x))
```

In proper English, mapping `f` is equivalent to `ap`ing a functor of `f`. Or in properer English, we can place `x` into our container and `map(f)` OR we can lift both `f` and `x` into our container and `ap` them. This allows us to write in a left-to-right fashion:

这行代码翻译成英语就是，map 一个 `f` 等价于 `ap` 一个值为 `f` 的 functor。或者更好的译法是，你既可以把 `x` 放到容器里然后调用 `map(f)`，也可以同时让 `f` 和 `x` 发生 lift（参看第 8 章），然后对他们调用 `ap`。这让我们能够以一种从左到右的方式编写代码：

```js
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe.of(2)).ap(Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

Task.of(add).ap(Task.of(2)).ap(Task.of(3));
// Task(5)
```

One might even recognise the vague shape of a normal function call if viewed mid squint. We'll look at the pointfree version later in the chapter, but for now, this is the preferred way to write such code. Using `of`, each value gets transported to the magical land of containers, this parallel universe where each application can be async or null or what have you and `ap` will apply functions within this fantastical place. It's like building a ship in a bottle.

细心的读者可能发现了，上述代码中隐约有普通函数调用的影子。没关系，我们稍后会学习 `ap` 的 pointfree 版本；暂时先把这当作此类代码的推荐写法。通过使用 `of`，每一个值都被输送到了各个容器里的奇幻之地，就像是在另一个平行世界里，每个程序都可以是异步的或者是 null 或者随便什么值，而且不管是什么，`ap` 都能在这个平行世界里针对这些值应用各种各样的函数。这就像是在一个瓶子中造船。

Did you see there? We used `Task` in our example. This is a prime situation where applicative functors pull their weight. Let's look at a more in-depth example.

你注意到没？上例中我们使用了 `Task`，这是 applicative functor 主要的用武之地。现在我们来看一个更深入的例子。

## Coordination Motivation

Say we're building a travel site and we'd like to retrieve both a list of tourist destinations and local events. Each of these are separate, stand-alone api calls.

```js
// Http.get :: String -> Task Error HTML

var renderPage = curry(function(destinations, events) { /* render page */  });

Task.of(renderPage).ap(Http.get('/destinations')).ap(Http.get('/events'))
// Task("<div>some page with dest and events</div>")
```

Both `Http` calls will happen instantly and `renderPage` will be called when both are resolved. Contrast this with the monadic version where one `Task` must finish before the next fires off. Since we don't need the destinations to retrieve events, we are free from sequential evaluation.

Again, because we're using partial application to achieve this result, we must ensure `renderPage` is curried or it will not wait for both `Tasks` to finish. Incidentally, if you've ever had to do such a thing manually, you'll appreciate the astonishing simplicity of this interface. This is the kind of beautiful code that takes us one step closer to the singularity.

Let's look at another example.

```js
// Helpers:
// ==============
//  $ :: String -> IO DOM
var $ = function(selector) {
  return new IO(function(){ return document.querySelector(selector) });
}

//  getVal :: String -> IO String
var getVal = compose(map(_.prop('value')), $);

// Example:
// ===============
//  signIn :: String -> String -> Bool -> User
var signIn = curry(function(username, password, remember_me){ /* signing in */  })

IO.of(signIn).ap(getVal('#email')).ap(getVal('#password')).ap(IO.of(false));
// IO({id: 3, email: "gg@allin.com"})
```

`signIn` is a curried function of 3 arguments so we have to `ap` accordingly. With each `ap`, `signIn` receives one more argument until it is complete and runs. We can continue this pattern with as many arguments as necessary. Another thing to note is that two arguments end up naturally in `IO` whereas the last one needs a little help from `of` to lift it into `IO` since `ap` expects the function and all its arguments to be in the same type.

## Bro, do you even lift?

Let's examine a pointfree way to write these applicative calls. Since we know `map` is equal to `of/ap`, we can write generic functions that will `ap` as many times as we specify:

```js
var liftA2 = curry(function(f, functor1, functor2) {
  return functor1.map(f).ap(functor2);
});

var liftA3 = curry(function(f, functor1, functor2, functor3) {
  return functor1.map(f).ap(functor2).ap(functor3);
});

//liftA4, etc
```

`liftA2` is a strange name. It sounds like one of the finicky freight elevators in a rundown factory or a vanity plate for a cheap limo company. Once enlightened, however, it's self explanatory: lift these pieces into the applicative functor world.

When I first saw this 2-3-4 nonsense it struck me as ugly and unnecessary, after all, we can check arity of functions in JavaScript and build this up dynamically. However, it is often useful to partially apply `liftA(N)` itself, so it cannot vary in argument length.

Let's see this in use:

```js
// checkEmail :: User -> Either String Email
// checkName :: User -> Either String String

//  createUser :: Email -> String -> IO User
var createUser = curry(function(email, name) { /* creating... */ });

Either.of(createUser).ap(checkEmail(user)).ap(checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email")

liftA2(createUser, checkEmail(user), checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email")
```

Since `createUser` takes two arguments, we use the corresponding `liftA2`. The two statements are equivalent, but the `liftA2` version has no mention of `Either`. This makes it more generic and flexible since we are no longer married to a specific type.


Let's see the previous examples written this way:

```js
liftA2(add, Maybe.of(2), Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

liftA2(renderPage, Http.get('/destinations'), Http.get('/events'))
// Task("<div>some page with dest and events</div>")

liftA3(signIn, getVal('#email'), getVal('#password'), IO.of(false));
// IO({id: 3, email: "gg@allin.com"})
```


## Operators

In languages like haskell, scala, PureScript, and swift, where it is possible to create your own infix operators you may see syntax like this:

```hs
-- haskell
add <$> Right 2 <*> Right 3
```

```js
// JavaScript
map(add, Right(2)).ap(Right(3))
```

It's helpful to know that `<$>` is `map` (aka `fmap`) and `<*>` is just `ap`. This allows for a more natural function application style and can help remove some parenthesis.

# Free can openers
<img src="images/canopener.jpg" alt="http://breannabeckmeyer.com/drawing.html" />

We haven't spoken much about derived functions. Seeing as all of these interfaces are built off of each other and obey a set of laws, we can define some weaker interfaces in terms of the stronger ones.

For instance, we know that an applicative is first a functor, so if we have an applicative instance, surely we can define a functor for our type.

This kind of perfect computational harmony is possible because we're working within a mathematical framework. Mozart couldn't have done better even if he had torrented ableton as a child.

I mentioned earlier that `of/ap` is equivalent to `map`. We can use this knowledge to define `map` for free:

```js
// map derived from of/ap
X.prototype.map = function(f) {
  return this.constructor.of(f).ap(this);
}
```

Monads are at the top of the food chain, so to speak, so if we have `chain`, we get functor and applicative for free:

```js
// map derived from chain
X.prototype.map = function(f) {
  var m = this;
  return m.chain(function(a) {
    return m.constructor.of(f(a));
  });
}

// ap derived from chain/map
X.prototype.ap = function(other) {
  return this.chain(function(f) {
    return other.map(f);
  });
};
```

If we can define a monad, we can define both the applicative and functor interfaces. This is quite remarkable as we get all of these can openers for free. We can even examine a type and automate this process.

It should be pointed out that part of `ap`'s appeal is the ability to run things concurrently so defining it via `chain` is missing out on that optimization. Despite that, it's good to have an immediate working interface while one works out the best possible implementation.

Why not just use monads and be done with it, you ask? It's good practice to work with the level of power you need, no more, no less. This keeps cognitive load to a minimum by ruling out possible functionality. For this reason, it's good to favor applicatives over monads.

Monads have the unique ability to sequence computation, assign variables, and halt further execution all thanks to the downward nesting structure. When one sees applicatives in use, they needn't concern themselves with any of that business.

Now, on to the legalities...

# Laws

Like the other mathematical constructs we've explored, applicative functors hold some useful properties for us to rely on in our daily code. First off, you should know that applicatives are "closed under composition", meaning `ap` will never change container types on us(yet another reason to favor over monads). That's not to say we cannot have multiple different effects - we can stack our types knowing that they will remain the same during the entirety of our application.

To demonstrate:

```js
  var tOfM = compose(Task.of, Maybe.of);

  liftA2(_.concat, tOfM('Rainy Days and Mondays'), tOfM(' always get me down'));
  // Task(Maybe(Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down))
```

See, no need to worry about different types getting in the mix.

Time to look at our favorite categorical law: *identity*:

### Identity

```js
// identity
A.of(id).ap(v) == v
```

Right, so applying `id` all from within a functor shouldn't alter the value in `v`. For example:

```js
var v = Identity.of("Pillow Pets");
Identity.of(id).ap(v) == v
```
`Identity.of(id)` makes me chuckle at its futility. Anyway, what's interesting is that, as we've already established, `of/ap` is the same as `map` so this law follows directly from functor identity: `map(id) == id`.

The beauty in using these laws is that, like a militant kindergarten gym coach, they force all of our interfaces to play well together.

### Homomorphism

```js
// homomorphism
A.of(f).ap(A.of(x)) == A.of(f(x))
```

A *homomorphism* is just a structure preserving map. In fact, a functor is just a *homomorphism* between categories as it preserves the original category's structure under the mapping.



We're really just stuffing our normal functions and values into a container and running the computation in there so it should come as no surprise that we will end up with the same result if we apply the whole thing inside the container (left side of the equation) or apply it outside, then place it in there (right side).

A quick example:

```js
Either.of(_.toUpper).ap(Either.of("oreos")) == Either.of(_.toUpper("oreos"))
```

### Interchange

The *interchange* states that it doesn't matter if we choose to lift our function into the left or right side of `ap`.

```js
// interchange
v.ap(A.of(x)) == A.of(function(f) { return f(x) }).ap(v)
```

Here is an example:

```js
var v = Task.of(_.reverse);
var x = 'Sparklehorse';

v.ap(Task.of(x)) == Task.of(function(f) { return f(x) }).ap(v)
```

### Composition

And finally composition which is just a way to check that our standard function composition holds when applying inside of containers.

```js
// composition
A.of(compose).ap(u).ap(v).ap(w) == u.ap(v.ap(w));
```

```js
var u = IO.of(_.toUpper);
var v = IO.of(_.concat("& beyond"));
var w = IO.of("blood bath ");

IO.of(_.compose).ap(u).ap(v).ap(w) == u.ap(v.ap(w))
```

## In Summary

A good use case for applicatives is when one has multiple functor arguments. They give us the ability to apply functions to arguments all within the functor world. Though we could already do so with monads, we should prefer applicative functors when we aren't in need of monadic specific functionality.

We're almost finished with container apis. We've learned how to `map`, `chain`, and now `ap` functions. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to work better with multiple functors and disassemble them in a principled way.
